# CSVtoSQL
A public-suitable release for an in-house developed hack to get around a difficult to overcome issue. Adding a frontend and some extra classes for handling the CSV file. Very simple and verbose but does what it does well. Tested with more files than I can shake a stick at although all files were likely in one characterset.

This frontend allows you to convert fields selected for display into SQL for use with a SQL insert statement.
