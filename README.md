# CSVParserFrontend
A public-suitable release for an in-house developed hack to get around a difficult to overcome issue. Adding a frontend and some extra classes for handling the CSV file. Very simple and verbose but does what it does well. Tested with more files than I can shake a stick at although all files were likely in one characterset.
